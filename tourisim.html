                        Downtown Beirut is the central district of Beirut, with its outdoor cafes restaurants and high end designer stores.
                        <br>
                        The inner area around Nejmeh Square is pedestrian-only. Ashrafieh is to its East, while Hamra, Ras Beirut, Manara and Rawcheh to its West.
                        <br>
                        Getting to downtown from other parts of Beirut or one of the bus stations is easy. Simple hop in any taxi/Service and ask for either "Downtown" or "Solidere"
                        <br>
                        Finding your way around can sometimes be confusing, since people rely on landmarks more than the official street numbers. Make sure you learn what the major landmarks in the area are, and make use a geolocation service such as PinLiban to write down exactly where you're going.
                        The point is, Downtown is a small area totally explorable by foot.

                       Raouché (Arabic: الروشة, romanized: ar-Rawše) is a residential and commercial neighborhood in Beirut, Lebanon.
                      <br>
                        It is known for its upscale apartment buildings, numerous restaurants, and cliff-side cafés that line Avenue de Paris, which forms part of the Corniche Beirut.
                      <br>
                        The corniche or the wide, seaside sidewalk of Avenue de Paris is popular on weekends and evenings where strollers and joggers crowd the pavements.

                       Located at Beirut's westernmost tip, the two huge rock formations, which stand like gigantic sentinels, are a popular destination for locals and visitors alike.<br>

                       Raouché also is claimed to be the remains of a sea monster the Greek hero Perseus killed to save Andromeda.<br> The stone is rock as Perseus used Medusa’s head on the monster to turn it into stone

                      Hamra Street or Rue Hamra (Arabic: شارع الحمراء) is one of the main streets of the city of Beirut, Lebanon, and one of the main economic and diplomatic
                      hubs of Beirut. It is located in the neighborhood of the same name, Hamra. Its technical name is Rue 31. Due to the numerous sidewalk cafes and theatres,
                      Hamra Street was the centre of intellectual activity in Beirut during the 1960s and 1970s.[1] Before 1975, Hamra Street and the surrounding district was known as Beirut's
                      trendiest, though in the post-war period it has arguably been eclipsed by Rue Monot in Ashrafieh, Rue Gouraud in Gemmayzeh, Rue Verdun, and downtown area.[2][3] In the mid 1990s,
                      the Municipality of Beirut gave a face lift to the street to reattract tourists all year round. Hamra Street was known as Beirut's Champs Elysées as it was frequented by tourists,
                      mostly Americans, Europeans and mega-rich Arabs, all year round.
                      Hamra lies directly on the West of Downtown Beirut. Hail a taxi or walk to the short distance.<br>
                      Expect traffic jam from 9am to 9pm, so let your taxi or your van drop you at the entrance of the area, and keep walking!<br>

											 North Forest, much of which is a nature reserve. Located at the extreme end of the Mount Lebanon range in the Akkar area, Qamouaa is considered an important tourist centre.
                        The surrounding heights rise to 2,454 meters and there are forests that are remarkable because of the abundance of such trees as junipers, hairy oaks,
                       cypresses, cedars and Cilician firs. Judging by the cedars to be found there, geologists say that these historic forests are at least a thousand years old. The plains of Qamoua
                        lie at 1,450 metres altitude in a sort of depression between the mountains.

											 Qammoua is the most important forest region of Lebanon. It covers 30 kilometers by 25, from the valley of Wadi Gehanam to the sources of Kobbayat, and from the source of Fnaydik to
                       that of the Nassarahs of Koubayat. This forest has more than 10 million trees of fifty different species, the most important of these including the junipers, cedars, and Cilician firs.

											 The forest has suffered considerable damage throughout its history, first of all at the hands of the British, who cut down a great number of the trees in order to use their trunks as
                       sleepers under the railway linking Lebanon’s North and South.                     </p>

                        Baalbek is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.
                        In Greek and Roman times Baalbek was also known as Heliopolis. In 1998 Baalbek had a population of 82,608, mostly Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians.
                        <br>
                        Ancient Aliens: “Eastern Lebanon – the Bar Car Valley. Here, at this archaeological site stand the ruins of Heliopolis built in the fourth century
                        BC by Alexander the Great to honour Zeus. But beneath the Corinthian columns and remnants of both Greek and Roman architecture lie the ruins of a site that is much, much older. According to archaeologists it dates back nearly 9,000 years.
                        The ancient city of Baalbek, named after the early Canaanite deity Baal.”
                        AA: “And so because it was already sacred to the god Baal then later the Greeks and the Romans would build temples on this very same spot.”
                        AA: “Archaeological surveys have revealed that the enormous stone foundation that lies at the base of the site dates back tens of thousands of years, but even more significant to ancient astronaut theorists
                        is their belief that the colossal stone platform may once have served as a landing pad for space travellers.”
                        The idea that Ancient Aliens will try to convey is that underneath the Roman ruins lies a very old platform that was once used to launch spacecraft.

                      Ms. Khawla's place in Baalbek is not like any other shrine, and has been an essential part of religious tourism in the region,
                      becoming a shrine to which Muslims accept prayers, prayers and, above all, blessings and pilgrimages.
                      But many questions must be asked in this context, perhaps the most prominent of which is why the shrine is located in this particular Bekaa region,
                      what brought Ms. Khawla to the Baalbek area of Lebanon? Why is her grave in this particular area? And what date does this discovery date back to? Is
                      there any interest from the State in it because it greatly stimulates religious tourism?
                      What brought Ms. Khawla to Lebanon?<br>
                      Al-Arefaf says that, after the martyrdom of Imam Hussein (as) in Karbala, on the eleventh day, the sisters, daughters and women of Imam Hussein took a arduous
                      journey from Karbala to Kufa and kufa to Damascus. Naturally, the journey to Damascus will take place in many countries and regions, and al-Sabaya marched from Aleppo,
                      Hama and Homs through various Lebanese areas, all the way to Baalbek and Marja Ras al-Ain, where the Ras Imam Hussein Mosque is located.

                      The Beqaa Valley (Arabic: وادي البقاع), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in classical antiquity as Coele-Syria,
                      is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region.[1] Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture.
                      The Beqaa is located about 30 km (19 mi) east of Beirut. The valley is situated between Mount Lebanon to the west and the Anti-Lebanon mountains to the east.
                      It forms the northeasternmost extension of the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from Syria to the Red Sea. Beqaa Valley is 120 kilometres (75 mi) long and
                      16 kilometres (9.9 mi) wide on average. It has a Mediterranean climate of wet, often snowy winters and dry, warm summers.
                      The region receives limited rainfall, particularly in the north, because Mount Lebanon creates a rain shadow that blocks precipitation coming from the sea.
                      The northern section has an average annual rainfall of 230 millimetres (9.1 in), compared to 610 millimetres (24 in) in the central valley. Nevertheless,
                      two rivers originate in the valley: the Orontes (Asi), which flows north into Syria and Turkey, and the Litani, which flows south and then west to the Mediterranean Sea.

                      Afqa Waterfall is located in the Jbeil District of the Mount Lebanon, 71 kilometres northeast of Beirut.

                      Afqa waterfall is one of the finest waterfalls in the mountains of the Middle East, which feeds into the Adonis River (known today as Abraham River or Nahr Ibrahim in Arabic).

                      The best time to visit the water fall is late winter and early spring.<br>
                      This impressive 72m waterfall was the lone waterfall we encountered on our Kenyan safari.

                      Unfortunately, I also suffered from a pretty bad case of food poisoning, which kept us from going down to the bottom.

                      Nevertheless, with waterfalls like this in a country where big game safaris rule most of the tourism traffic, we found it refreshing to mix things up a bit.

                      And this kind of waterfall certainly had legitimate size and flow to hopefully find more like it on a future trip.

                      The populated area called Miziara is formed of four villages: Miziara, Harf Miziara, Houmeis and Sakhra.
                      The Historian Boutros Béchara Karam wrote in his book The Coral Chain in the history of North Lebanon that the family of Naamtallah Néhmé stayed in Rishtaamout for about seventy years. The family did not grow or branch out. Spending winters, springs and autumns
                       in the farm. But summers were spent in Ejbeh, where they bought a hill and built a church on it, which is still known as Saint George Mountain.

                      Naamtallah Néhmé family requested from the rulers of Jebbet Bsharri, the Shiite Hamadeh, the permission to live in Houmeis, a ruined village and its nearby forest which is now known as Miziara. Their request was granted.

                      Younis and his family moved to Houmeis. The other three brothers Youssef, Abdallah and Abdel Ahad settled in the forest with their families, as its location and atmosphere gave them great pleasure. So Youssef, son of Naamtallah Néhmé, became the founder of Miziara as was recorded by the Historians.

                       Mount Hermon, also known as Jabal El Haramoun or Jabal El Sheikh, is the highest peak in
                       the Anti-Lebanon eastern mountain chain, located between Lebanon, Syria, and the IsraeliPalestinian territories. Since antiquity, this mountain has been considered holy, a fact to which
                       many archaeological remains bear testament. At present, one can count hundreds of religious sites
                       from different religious communities including Christians – Maronite, Orthodox, Catholic, and
                       Evangelical – as well as Sunnis and Druze. In the Bible we can find more than 70 references to Mount
                       Hermon. It is said locally that Jesus Christ was transfigured at its top. The security issues related to

                      Beaufort or Belfort Castle, known locally as Qal'at al-Shaqif (Arabic: قلعة الشقيف, romanized: Qalʾāt al-Shaqīf)[1] or Shaqif Arnun, is a Crusader fortress in Nabatieh Governorate, Southern Lebanon,
                       about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-south-east of the village of Arnoun. There was a fortification on the site before it was captured by Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in 1139 and construction of the
                        Crusader castle probably began soon after. Saladin captured Beaufort in 1190, but 60 years later Crusaders re-took it. In 1268 Sultan Baibars finally captured the castle for the Islamic forces.

                      Beaufort provides one of the few cases in which a medieval castle proved of military value and utility in modern warfare as well, as its late 20th-century history shows.

                      Naqoura (Arabic: الناقورة, Enn Nâqoura, Naqoura, An Nāqūrah) is a small city in southern Lebanon. Since March 23, 1978, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been headquartered in Naqoura.
                      In 1875, during the late Ottoman era, Victor Guérin described it: "The village stands upon a hill, on the south of which is a deep way, through which flows a spring called 'Ain Nakurah, which waters plantations
                      of fig-trees and olives mixed with palms. The village contains 400 Metawileh. The houses are modern, but some of the materials appear ancient by their regularity and dimensions. There must, therefore, have been an older
                       village here, the name of which was probably similar, if not identical."[2] According to Guérin, the place is associated with the historic Ladder of the Tyrians (Scala Tyriorum).[3]

                      In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it: "A village, built of stone, containing about 250 Moslems, situated on low hills by sea-coast. Gardens of olives, palms, pomegranates, figs, and arable land ; brushwood to the east. Two springs with plentiful supply of water."

                      The village is surrounded by mountain peaks, pine and oak forests. Its altitude ranges from 740 to 1605 m and is 83 km from the capital Beirut.<br>
                      Al Rehan (pronounced /Al re-han) is the village's name in Arabic and refers to its namesake, Mount Rehan.
                      Both village and mount are named after the Basil (Rehan in Arabic) plant that grows abundantly in the area.
                      Its closest neighbouring villages are Aramta, Sujod and Ayshiya. Additionally, mountains outside the Lebanese boundaries can be seen from the top of the village and specifically from the Al Ksayri area.
                      Rehan in the summer season.
                      The number of people inhabiting the village is estimated to be approximately 5000 people of Lebanese descent.
                      Its inhabitants are also spread all over the world where most have migrated to various countries in the Middle East, Africa, North and South America, Canada and Europe.
